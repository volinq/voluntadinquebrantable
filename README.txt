Voluntad Inquebrantable - Full Warm Bilingual Static Site (GitHub Pages ready)

Files included (root):
- index.html, about.html, programs.html, contact.html, thank-you.html
- /es/ (Spanish versions)
- /assets/styles.css
- /assets/images/logo.png (your logo if provided)
- Uses free Unsplash images linked directly so they display live on the site.

Form handling:
- Contact forms use Formsubmit.co and will send submissions to: abecerrag03@gmail.com
  (No backend required. You may receive a confirmation email from formsubmit the first time.)

To deploy:
1. Create a GitHub repository named 'voluntadinq.org' (or use existing) and upload the files at the root.
2. In GitHub repo Settings -> Pages, set source to branch 'main' and folder '/ (root)'. Save.
3. Ensure DNS for voluntadinq.org points to GitHub Pages as previously configured.
4. Wait for HTTPS certificate; then enable 'Enforce HTTPS'.

Notes:
- Images are hotlinked from Unsplash (free to use). If you prefer local copies, I can download and include them in the assets/images folder.
- To change contact recipient, update the form action in contact.html and /es/contact.html.
